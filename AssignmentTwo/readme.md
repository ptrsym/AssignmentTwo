# MAD Assignment 2


## Milestone 1

24/05/23 
created coredata and persistence files

25/05/23 
mapped object requirements and design requirements
made the coredata objects and their relationships set some constraints on longitude and latitude
built barebones content, placerow and detail view 
researched utilising managed context within extensions and functions
built new place function
investigated how entity relationships are retrieved from the context
realised I would get a runtime error from intialising an empty collection on first launch so added a conditional to the add new place button
